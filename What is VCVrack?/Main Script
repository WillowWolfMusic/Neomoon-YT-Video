What is VCVrack, and what can it do? 

VCVrack is a free, open source, modular synthesizer program, capable of accurately recreating the sound and functionality of expensive hardware 
synthesizers 

vcvrack enables people to create complex synthesis patches using an intuitive system of knobs and visual
cable connections

well. 

Known for emulating the eurorrack hardware format, VCVrack recreates not only the logic of eurorrack, but also 
specific famous modules, such as X and Y and Z 

but vcvrack is so much more than that, with 

bosting over 3.5k modules, almost all free to download, vcvrack has a thriving community of module developers.
